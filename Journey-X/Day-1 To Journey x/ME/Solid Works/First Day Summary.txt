So I learnt Modelling with CAD
Learnt the following tools of the same
(2D only)
1)Line
2)Smart Dimensions
3)Reference Point Lines and its usage (Dotted Lines)
4)Collinearity
5)Tangent and Relations
6)Importance of Frame of Reference CP (Center Point) for a well defined 3D object
7)Trim Tools
8)Mirror Tools (partially)

Experimented With The following
1)3D Extrusion
->What I did was to draw a well defined circle and extrude through the cube
what I did was I connected diagonal starting from the corner at the origin
I took its midpoint and then drawn a circle from that reference which actually made it a fully defined Geometry
(without tutorial)

2)ANSYS Mechanical

1)Import Geometry
2)Meshing and Refinement
3)Material Selection init
4)Boundary Conditions (eg Types of force plane,vectors or coordinates etc)
5)What you want from the data
(with tutorial)
etc etc
Tried hands on ANSYS CFX AND FLUENT WITH FLUENT MESHING WITHOUT "TUTORIAL"
but didn't get it and there were errors to
so time to wind the day up
